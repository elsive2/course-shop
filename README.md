<h1 align="center">Course Shop Application</h1>

<p>This project is a full-fledged store where you have the opportunity to buy any of the courses on the site.</p>

<p>At the moment I created this application, I've been studying node for about a month, and I really believe that for that amount of time the project is pretty decent.</p>

<p>I would like to warn you right away that if you see what an ugly layout, then you should know that on this project I put more emphasis on the backend component, not the frontend one.</p>

Yes, yes, you can buy several identical courses ( I donâ€™t know why :grin::see_no_evil:)
